Sign Up/Sign In functionalities are made possible by BCrypt.

### Sign Up

Sign up starts from the splash page, where people select their gender and
sexual orientation, then it proceeds to ask more information, including their birthday and
location

![signup](https://github.com/imoran/alrightCupid/blob/master/signup.png)

All of this information is being passed as part of the signup slice of the state. Here is a sample

```javascript
{
  entities: {
    ui: {
      signup: {
        age: 25,
        first_name: "Bob",
        gender: "Other",
        orientation: "Other",
        location: "United States",
        zipcode: "94105"
      }
      modal:
    },
    errors: {
      *login: ["Incorrect username/password combination", "Password too short", "Username taken"],*
      session: []
    },
    session: {
      currentUser: null
  }
}
```

Custom error messages are displayed when information is missing.

![signup_errors](https://github.com/imoran/alrightCupid/blob/master/errors.png)

```javascript
  // all errors are kept in local state and when any of the categories are missing,
  // it adds that specific error to the array, and so we render as many errors as there were present.

  this.state = {
    first_name: '',
    month: 'Month',
    day: 'Day',
    year: 'Year',
    location: 'United States',
    zipcode: '',
    nameError: [],
    zipError: [],
    birthError: []
  };

  let nameError = first_name.length === 0 ? ['Sorry, your name canâ€™t be blank.'] : [];
  let zipError = zipcode.length !== 5 ? ['Location is required.'] : [];
  let birthError = [];
  if (month === 'Month' || day === 'Day' || year === 'Year') {
    birthError = ["Something's missing!"];
  } else if ((currentYear - year) < 18 ) {
    birthError = ["You must be at least 18 years old to use AlrightCupid."];
  }
```

Finally, it gets the users' username and password.

This multi-step form made use of the signin slice of state, adding all the
required fields in order to create a user.

To avoid using different routes for each stage of the signin process,
I created a nextStep field of the local state of each component that
belonged to each stage. Each time the user clicked on the button that
led to the next page, step would be increased by one and the respective component
would be rendered

```javascript
  multiStep() {
    let color = "#24d8f3";
    switch (this.state.step) {
      case 1:
        return (
          <div className={this.state.css}>
            <HeaderContainer />
            <Splash />
            <SignUp1 nextStep={this.nextStep} />
          </div>);
      case 2:
        return <SignUp2
          nextStep={this.nextStep}
          css={color}
           />;
      case 3:
        return <SignUp3 css={color}/>;
      default:
        break;
    }
  }

  nextStep() {
    this.setState({
      step : this.state.step + 1
    });
  }
```
